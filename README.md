# Custom Drag-and-Drop Application in React

This project is a lightweight solution for intuitive, custom drag-and-drop component built without any external libraries. It allows users to drag items from a list and drop them into a designated drop zone. The dropped items remain in the position where theyâ€™re released, and users have the option to remove items from the drop zone and which sends them back to their original list. This drag-and-drop component can be reused and tailored to fit various application requirements.


## Functionalities

This solution provides the following functionalities:
- **Drag and Drop**: Move items from a list into a drop zone.
- **Reset Capability**: Items in the drop zone can be removed and returned to the original list.
- **Precise Positioning**: Items can be positioned based on the position where they are droped, providing intuitive control over item positioning.

- **Improved Styling**: Improve visual indicators to show where a new item would be placed within the drop zone in order to guide users on possible drop locations and displaying automatic reordering of existing items withing the drop zone.
- **Persistent State**: Save dropped item positions to local storage or a database, so positions are retained upon page refresh.
